# Hospital DBMS
This project is an example DBMS created for a fictitous hospital for the use of the facility's management to handle staff, patients and resources.

## Summary of System Requirements
### Departments & Resources
The hospital consists of several distinct departments of which different types of employees are assigned to. Each department is supported by a budget and set of hospital resources which are assigned to patients on a case by case basis. The budget determines the number of employees and amount of hospital resources available. Each department is of its own type and contains data including location, available rooms, list and number of employees, list and number of patients. They keep track of their available resources (medical equipment, patient room necessities, office supplies, pharmaceuticals, etc.). A budget is also designated, which determines the resources and staff available.

### Employees & Scheduling
Each employee is designated a schedule and assigned a number of patients and cases within that department. Employees consist of all hospital staff including: doctors, nurses, receptionists, technicians, pharmacists, sanitary workers, food staff, medical assistants, interns, and the management team. The database would keep a record of each employee along with their personal information such as: name, address, salary, employee ID, etc. The employees are assigned to work on a schedule which specifies what shift each employee works. The database will keep track of the shift date, start and end times of each employee.

### Patients
The database holds a record of each patientâ€™s case. Doctors and nurses are assigned to handle a particular case determined by their specialization. The case includes information such as the patient name and ID, room number, doctor/nurse name, hospital resources needed/used, prescriptions, actions taken by personnel, and who the patient was admitted by. Patient documentation is archived with necessary information (name, date of birth, insurance, medical history, current case, prior cases, admittance date and discharge date). Depending on their condition, a patient will be housed under a specific department.
